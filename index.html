            <p>Education is the most powerful weapon which can be used to change the world We aims to provide quality education to the needy and help them to live better. 1 in 11 children go to work when they should be in school. When it is hard to afford necessities like food, shelter, and clothing; education becomes a luxury that the poor give up. Illiteracy then leads to further poverty. Donate for child education in India, support them with fees, school supplies, footwear, transport and opportunities to showcase their talents.</p>
              <p>20 Million children in India do not go to school. Millions of children are still denied their right to education because of poverty. Donate for the education of poor children and support them with necessities like tuition fees, school supplies, footwear, transport, etc. Help them build a future that will make them escape poverty passed from generation to generation.</p>

            <p>Every penny donated makes a huge difference to the work we do, young children and their families. It literally can mean a case of life or death for some.

While all gifts are gratefully received, a regular donation is best for the charity to be able to plan ahead to achieve its goals in relieving people from poverty.By donating to our general fund, this enables us to wisely use the money where the greatest need is at any particular time. By delivering help on the ground through our project partnerships we can help change lives by meeting their basic needs.Our projects are designed to empower greater self-sufficiency, new hope and a more sustainable future. A handshake not a handout.

          <h1>Help us eradicate hunger in India</h1>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>194 million people in India today do not have enough food to eat, the largest in any one country in the world. According to the Global Hunger Index 2020, India falls under the ‘serious’ hunger category with a rank of 94 among 107 countries.
          These statistics however, do not take into account the effects of COVID-19. The resultant migration, unemployment and loss of earning members of households has pushed millions of Indians into extreme poverty and hunger.</p>
